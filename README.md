# Fake Windows 10 Shutdown
This is a Windows 'Shutdown' program.

By opening it, it will only show a 'Shutting Down' UI and will hibernate after 10s. If anyone tries to turn on the PC, it'll still show the Shutting-Down UI while the only way to quit is to press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd>

Give a Star to this repo, it's free and you can always change your mind, but it's really important to me. Enjoy it. `:)`
